This API enables users to manage tasks, submit files, and store outputs generated by users' programs. Below is the documentation for each available route.

## Endpoints
### 1. Create Task
    Endpoint: /createTask
    Method: POST

#### Request example: 

```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/createTask \
  -F "taskID=1" \
  -F "overwrite=false" \
  -F "description=@/path/to/description.pdf" \
  -F "inputFiles=@/path/to/input1.txt" \
  -F "inputFiles=@/path/to/input2.txt" \
  -F "outputFiles=@/path/to/output1.txt" \
  -F "outputFiles=@/path/to/output2.txt"
```

#### Response:

- Success: 200 OK with the message "Task directory created successfully"
- Failure: 400 or 500 error code with a specific error message.

  -F "userID=1" \
  -F "submissionFile=@/path/to/solution.c"
```

#### Response:

- Success: 200 OK with the message "Submission created successfully"
- Failure: 400 or 500 error code with a specific error message.

### 3. Store Outputs

    Endpoint: /storeOutputs

- The number of files in outputs must match the expected number specified in the taskID/src/output folder.

#### Request example (with output files):

```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/storeOutputs \
  -F "taskID=1" \
  -F "userID=1" \
  -F "submissionNumber=1" \
  -F "outputs=@/path/to/output1.txt" \
  -F "outputs=@/path/to/output2.txt"
```

#### Request example (with an error file):

```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/storeOutputs \
  -F "taskID=1" \
  -F "userID=1" \
  -F "submissionNumber=1" \
  -F "error=@/path/to/compile-error.err"
```

#### Response:


- Success:
    - 200 OK with "Output files stored successfully" if outputs were provided.
