# File Storage API

This API enables users to manage tasks, submit files, and store outputs generated by users' programs. Below is the documentation for each available route.

## Endpoints
### 1. Create Task
    Endpoint: /createTask
    Method: POST
    Description: Creates a new task directory with a specified structure, including input and output files.

#### Request Body (Form-Data):

#### Request example: 

```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/createTask \
  -F "taskID=1" \
  -F "overwrite=false" \
  -F "description=@/path/to/description.pdf" \
  -F "inputFiles=@/path/to/input1.txt" \
  -F "inputFiles=@/path/to/input2.txt" \
  -F "outputFiles=@/path/to/output1.txt" \

- The number of files in outputs must match the expected number specified in the taskID/src/output folder.

#### Request example (with output files):

```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/storeOutputs \
  -F "taskID=1" \
  -F "userID=1" \
  -F "submissionNumber=1" \
  -F "outputs=@/path/to/output1.txt" \
  -F "outputs=@/path/to/output2.txt"
```

#### Request example (with an error file):

```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/storeOutputs \
  -F "taskID=1" \
  -F "userID=1" \
  -F "submissionNumber=1" \
  -F "error=@/path/to/compile-error.err"
```

#### Response:


- Success:
    - 200 OK with "Output files stored successfully" if outputs were provided.
    - 200 OK with "Error file stored successfully" if error was provided.
- Failure: 400 or 500 error code with a specific error message.

### 4. Get Task Files
    Endpoint: /getTaskFiles
    Method: GET
    Description: Retrieves all files (description, input, and output) for a given task.

#### Query Params
- taskID (required): Integer ID of the task.

Request example:

```bash
  curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/getTaskFiles?taskID=123'
```

#### Response:
- Success: Returns a .tar.gz file containing the task's src folder, named as task{taskID}Files.tar.gz. The archive includes:
  - description.pdf file if present
  - input/ folder with all input .txt files
  - output/ folder with all output .txt files 
- Failure: 400 or 500 error code with a specific error message.

### 5. Get User Submission
    Endpoint: /getUserSubmission
    Method: GET
    Description: Fetches the specific submission file for a user. It will replace the current getFiles from solution.go. For now it should check if there is only one program file.

#### Query Params
- taskID (required): Integer ID of the task.
- userID (required): Integer ID of the user.
- submissionNumber (required): Integer indicating the submission version for which the output files are stored.

Request example:

```bash
  curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/getUserSubmission?taskID=123&userID=1&submissionNumber=1'
```

#### Response:
- Success: Returns a file containing user's solution for the requested submission
- Failure: 400 or 500 error code with a specific error message.
